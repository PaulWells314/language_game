Metasurfaces represent a powerful paradigm of optical engineering that enables one to control the flow of light across material interfaces. We report on a discovery that metallic metasurfaces of a certain type respond differently to spatially coherent and incoherent light, enabling robust speckle-free discrimination between different degrees of coherence. The effect has no direct analogue in conventional optics and may find applications in compact metadevices enhancing imaging, vision, detection, communication and metrology.
