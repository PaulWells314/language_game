Photonic crystals are periodic structures which prevent light propagation along one or more directions in certain frequency intervals. Their band spectrum is usually analyzed using Floquet-Bloch decomposition. This spectrum is located on the real axis, and it enters the complex plane when absorption and dispersion is considered in the dielectric permittivity of material constituents. Here, we review fundamental definition and properties of dispersion law and group velocity in photonic crystals and we illustrate them with numerical examples.
