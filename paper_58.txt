It is thought that the spacetime metric around astrophysical black holes is well described by the
Kerr solution of Einstein’s gravity. However, a robust observational evidence of the Kerr nature
of these objects is still lacking. Here we fit the X-ray spectrum of the stellar-mass black hole in
GS 1354–645 with a disk reflection model beyond Einstein’s gravity in order test the Kerr black
hole hypothesis. We consider the Johannsen metric with the deformation parameters α13 and α22.
The Kerr metric is recovered for α13 = α22 = 0. For α22 = 0, our measurements of the black hole
spin and of the deformation parameter α13 are a∗ > 0.975 and −0.34 < α13 < 0.16, respectively.
For α13 = 0, we find a∗ > 0.975 and −0.09 < α22 < 0.42. All the reported uncertainties are at 99%
of confidence level for two relevant parameters.
