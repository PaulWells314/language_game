Typically speckle patterns only possess short-range (local) intensity correlations, which are determined by the spatial field correlations. Here we experimentally demonstrate how to create speckles with strong long-range (non-local) intensity correlations by modulating the phase front of a laser beam. By carefully encoding high-order correlations into phase patterns on a spatial light modulator, the far-field speckle patterns exhibit a diverse range of non-local intensity correlations while the local correlations are unaltered. The intensity correlation length can be made significantly longer than the field correlation length when the strength of non-local intensity correlations is comparable to that of local intensity correlations. More generally, we can arbitrarily tailor the intensity correlation function, for example making it anisotropic and oscillating spatially, without modifying the field correlation function. The ability to enhance and control non-local correlations in speckle patterns, demonstrated in this work, provides new opportunities in point-spread-function engineering for speckle-based fluorescence microscopy and in the design of correlated random optical potentials for atoms and particles.
