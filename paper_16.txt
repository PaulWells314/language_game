Curved reflective mirrors play an indispensable role in widely-employed Cassegrain-type optics, which consequently are inevitably bulky, and thus neither integratable nor well extendable. Through substituting geometric phase based reflective metasurfaces for curved mirrors, here a planar Cassegrain-type Schwarzschild objective is obtained, with both the focusing and imaging functionalities experimentally verified. The planar reflective objective achieved is intrinsically free of residual light and thus imposes less stringent restrictions on illuminating light and nanofabrications compared to its refractive counterpart. Our planar Cassegrain-type designs can potentially reshape and simplify the core components of the microscope and telescope systems working at a broadband spectral range, and thus opens new avenues for designing compact imaging systems.
