Using two novel methods, pair invariant mass (minv) and comparative measurements with respect to reaction plane
(ΨRP) and participant plane (ΨPP), we isolate the possible chiral magnetic effect (CME) from backgrounds in 200 GeV
Au+Au collisions at STAR. The invariant mass method identifies the resonance background contributions, coupled with
the elliptic flow (v2), to the charge correlator CME observable (∆γ). At high mass (minv > 1.5 GeV/c2) where resonance
contribution is small, we obtain the average ∆γ magnitude. In the low mass region (minv < 1.5 GeV/c2), resonance peaks
are observed in ∆γ(minv). An event shape engineering (ESE) method is used to model the background shape in minv to
extract the potential CME signal at low minv. In the comparative method, the ΨRP is assessed by spectator neutrons
measured by ZDC, and the ΨPP by the 2nd-harmonic event plane measured by the TPC. The v2 is stronger along ΨPP
and weaker along ΨRP; in contrast, the magnetic field, mainly from spectator protons, is weaker along ΨPP and stronger
along ΨRP. As a result, the ∆γ measured with respect to ΨRP and ΨPP contain different amounts of CME and background,
and can thus determine these two contributions. It is found that the possible CME signals with background isolation by
these two novel methods are small, on the order of a few percent of the inclusive ∆γ measurements.
