Understanding light-matter interaction in disordered photonic media allows people to manipulate
light scattering and achieve exciting applications using seemingly scrambled media. As the concentration
of scattering particles rises, they are inclined to step into near fields of each other in deep
subwavelength scale. The fundamental physics involving the interplay between disorder and nearfield
interaction (NFI) is still not fully understood. We theoretically examine the role of NFI by
analyzing the underlying multiple scattering mechanism. We find NFI leads to a stronger collective
behavior involving more particles and widens the photonic pseudo-bandgap of disordered media. It
also excites more weakly decayed longitudinal modes and results in higher local density of states. By
introducing a sticky short-range order, we demonstrate the possibility of enhancing off-momentumshell
NFI of multiple scattering process. Our results have profound implications in understanding
and harnessing nanoscale light-matter interaction for novel disordered photonic devices.
